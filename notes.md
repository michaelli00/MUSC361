# Unit 1

## Understanding Modernism

- **Aesthetics**: What does modernism sound like?

  - Dissolution of tonality
  - Dissolution of rhythm/meter
  - Dissolution of traditional forms/genres
  - New (a)tonalities/rhythms/forms

- **Ideology**: What are modernism values or beliefs?

  - Art should be difficult, should challenge audience with something radical
  - Art should be new (new languages, constantly reinventing/evolving music, disrupting past musical conventions)
  - Art should respond to society (critical of current events e.g. wars, social movements).

- **Limits**: Do these examples fit into our definition of modernism

  - Modernism is an exclusionary discourse (narrow mindset e.g. jazz wasn't included in modernism)
    - Often anti-popular music
    - Often anti-"conservative" music (didn't like composers who focused on old style of music)
  - Modernism is a racialized and gendered discourse (usually focused on only white men)

- **Interdisciplinary**: aesthetics, ideology, and limits affect art in other fields (e.g. visual art). Also modernist arts are collaborating across disciplines (different fields influencing other fields)

  - Visual art focused on abstraction and criticizing society/modern issues
  - Modernism writing comments on society/modern issues
  - **Gesamtkunstwerk** -- Collaboration across disciplines

## Introduction to Arnold Schoenberg

- Personal crisis/psychological exploration: Gerstl affair/death
- Idea of Expressionism: modernist artistic movement in the early 20th century
  - Outer world mimics psychological turmoil
  - "Art belongs to the unconscious"
- Interdisciplinary (influenced by Stefan George's poetry and his symbolism/expressionism)
- Historical justification
- Vocal writting: Sprechstimme -- speech-song
- Instrumentation: compact chamber ensemble -- instead of Wagnerian orchestra
  -  Each song rotates instruments
- Harmony: early (free) atonality -- still experimenting with atonal music writing
  - Rising minor 3rd, descending major 3rd theme
  - passacaglia: repeated baseline
  - roots his modernism/atonality in history
    - "Emancipation of dissonance"

### Wassily Kandinsky

Thought that creation of art as an "internal necessity". Focused on abstract art, specifically geometry. *Concerning the Spiritual in Art*

- Extremely disliked realism and materialism
- Thought the general audience is not smart enough to understand his art

## Mahler

> "A symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything"

Common themes between symphonies

- Big philosophical themes -- death, love, etc
- Maximalism -- maximize every element of the symphonic orchestra (more instruments, longer symphonies, more movements)
- Eclecticsm -- referencing other works (music and literary)
- Programmtic -- autobiographic/self-referential
- Post-Beethoven symphonies -- split between
    - Wagner/Lizst: New German School: (*Gesamtkunstwerk*) music based on symphonic poems/dramas (program music)
    - Brahms: absolute/stand-alone music (instrumental/abstract symphonies)
    - Mahler: brings the 2 worlds above together, bringing operatic ideas into symphonies

## 9/15

### WW1 Affect on Schoenberg's Music

- After WWI, artists reject expressionism, violence, nationalism. Instead *Neute Sachlichkeit* (New Ojbectivity) rises: turn away emotion and turns towards structure
- 19th century Nationalism explodes into violence
- Schoenberg goes 12-tone; he became exhausted from the expressionist style

Second Viennese School: Schoenberg, Berg, Webern

Institutions

## Wozzeck

Alban Berg's reaction to WWI, representing the common soldier in WWI

Freid psycoanalysis exploration in art

**Clip 1**

  - Musical jarring. Too much is going on in the world but ordinary person wants to just live his life

**Clip 2**

  - Losing grasp of meaning of life (drunk). 

**Clip 3**

  - Gas mask on child

### Quiz

# Unit 2

## Rite of Spring (Stravinsky)

Moving to world of Stravinksy (Paris)

Rite of Spring was poorly received at its premier (audience expected a ballet). Main goal of the piece was to depict ancient cultures in Russia, and based on old folklore and folk songs

- "The Augurs of Spring": 2 major chords (half step apart) played together to create clashing dissonance

    - Modernist dissonance and *polytonality*
    - Steady pulse but shifting accents (Modernist *rhythm*)
    - Large post-Wagner orchestra
    - Percussive strings (and entire orchestra)
    - Unusual use of winds and brass

- The Ballet
    
    - *Ballet Russes*: Ballet company from France that performed an interpretation of Russian works. Focused on Russian folklore
    - Look at slides for names of people that worked on *Rite of Spring* Ballet
    - *Rite of Spring* ballet goes against main teaching of ballet

        - Weight rather than lightness (note that the dance moves themselves were extremely difficult)
        - **Primitivism**: deliberate crude and modernist representation of ancient culture
        - Ballet highlights that the music is a **ritual**, not a **story**
        - Previous ballets were sexualized (provocative clothing), *Rite of Spring* isn't sexualized
        - Important to note that this was a interdisciplinary work (dance and music). However, because of the loud protest in the premiere, the audience only saw the dance.
